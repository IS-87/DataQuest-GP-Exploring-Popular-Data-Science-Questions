    "Before we go deeper, it is important to have a basic understanding of how a Stack Exchange site works. Simply put, any given Stack Exchange site is a question-answer site dedicated to a topic in a variety of categories, such as technology, culture, language, science, recreation, professional, and business. Here are some additional points explaining how a site works:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any user can ask a question, and any user can answer\n",
    "* Questions and answers can receive upvotes and downvotes from users\n",
    "* The default sorting method for questions is to show new questions or replies at the top\n",
    "* \"Hot\" sorting method allows to sort questions by the number of answers, views, and votes instead\n",
    "* Active and helpful users earn reputation points\n",
    "* Questions have to be on topic\n",
    "* Subjective questions are discouraged unless they are constructive, for example they may invite answers that explain \"Why\" and \"How\", or the sharing of experiences over opinions\n",
    "* Questions with a scope that is too broad or with a goal to start a discussion rather than look for an answer are not welcomed\n",
    "* Duplicate questions are marked as such by site's moderators\n",
    "\n",
    "DSSE home page has a number of elements besides the questions list:\n",
    "\n",
    "* search bar with text input\n",
    "* links to tags, users, unanswered questions, and jobs (not all sites have a job board)\n",
    "* links to popular questions from other sites\n",
    "* links to site-specific chat where questions and discussion rules are more relaxed\n",
    "\n",
    "Tags and unanswered question links may be useful in reaching our goal. We may take a two-prong approach of looking at popular tags with answers, and popular tags with no answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each question page has additional elements besides the question itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "* upvote / downvote icons\n",
    "* number of views - this may be useful in reaching our goal\n",
    "* comments from other users that are tied to the question - usually requests for additional information or clarification\n",
    "* answers from other users intending to answer the question at hand\n",
    "\n",
    "We can keep things simple and analyze tags by employing the same indicators that are present next to questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of votes\n",
    "* Number of answers\n",
    "* Number of views"
